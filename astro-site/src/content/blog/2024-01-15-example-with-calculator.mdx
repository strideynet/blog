import { SimpleCalculator } from '@/components/interactive/SimpleCalculator';

This is an example blog post that demonstrates how you can embed interactive React components directly into your blog posts using Astro and MDX.

## Interactive Calculator Demo

Below is a fully functional calculator built with React and Shadcn UI components. Try it out!

<SimpleCalculator client:load />

## How It Works

The calculator is a React component that lives in `src/components/interactive/SimpleCalculator.tsx`. By using MDX files instead of regular Markdown, we can import and use React components directly in our blog posts.

The `client:load` directive tells Astro to hydrate this component on the client side, making it interactive.

## Benefits

- **Interactive Content**: Engage your readers with interactive demos and tools
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for your components
- **Reusable**: Components can be shared across multiple posts
- **Performance**: Astro only loads JavaScript for interactive components

You can create all sorts of interactive components:
- Calculators
- Data visualizations
- Interactive demos
- Code playgrounds
- Games
- And much more!

This flexibility allows you to create rich, engaging content that goes beyond static text and images.
