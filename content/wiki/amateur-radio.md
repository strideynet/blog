title: Amateur Radio (M7NOA)
---

Hey, I'm Noah - on the air, you'll know me as M7NOA. I obtained my foundation license in 2023.

My QTH is London which limits my opportunities to operate. As such, I'll usually be found operating portable. Where I 
can, I try to activate POTA parks! I'm fond of FT8 and SSB across 40, 30 and 20m bands.

Please submit QSOs via Logbook of the World. I occasionally sync my QSOs to QRZ and eQSL, however, this occurs on a much
less regular basis.

I operate using:

- Icom IC705
- SOTABeam Bandhopper III
- Alpha Antenna AL705 Magloop
- LiteVNA

Other interests:

- LoRA
- Packet Radio
- Linux
