Hey, I'm Noah - on the air, you'll know me as 2E1OTT. I obtained my foundation license in 2023 and my intermediate in 2025.

My QTH is London which limits my opportunities to operate. As such, I'll usually be found operating portable. Where I 
can, I try to activate POTA parks! I'm fond of FT8 and SSB across 40, 30 and 20m bands.

Please submit QSOs via Logbook of the World. I occasionally sync my QSOs to QRZ and eQSL, however, this occurs on a much
less regular basis.

I operate using:

- Icom IC705 or IC7300
  - SOTABeam Bandhopper III
  - Alpha Antenna AL705 Magloop
- Anytone AT-D878UVII
- LiteVNA

Other interests:

- LoRA
- Packet Radio
- Linux

Callsign history:

- 2E1OTT
  - From 11th August 2025
- M7NOA 
  - From 27th September 2023 until 11th August 2025
