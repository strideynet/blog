Hey! I'm Noah, a software engineer based in London. Outside of work, you can find me DJing, hitting the gym or playing video games with my friends. I'm a huge music fiend and can almost always be found listening to music. In the winter, I'll often be seen hitting the slopes.

### 👨‍💻 Work

I love working with Go & building systems that integrates with Kubernetes and other container technologies. I've got passable frontend experience with Vue and React, but I'd much rather be knees-deep in an API. I consider my top three things to be:

- Go
- Kubernetes
- SRE/DevOps
  - Observability
  - GCP
  - Reliability & Incident Management

In terms of softer skills, I've really come to enjoy mentoring more junior engineers. When it comes to building products, I'm a huge fan of the Lean Startup's scientific approach to building incremental MVPs closely with customers to ensure that the product meets a real need.

### 💰 Want to hire me?

I'm not actively looking for new opportunities, but if you are an internal recruiter or hiring manager and have got something super exciting with worthy compensation, please feel free to get in touch (unless it's crypto, arms dealing or predatory lending). I usually am not interested in working with agency recruitment.

***So long, and thanks for all the fish***
