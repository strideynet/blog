Hey! I'm Noah, a software engineer based in London. Outside of work, you can find me DJing, climbing or playing video games. I'm a huge music fiend and can almost always be found listening to music. In the winter, I'll often be seen hitting the slopes.

## 👨‍💻 Work

I love working with Go & building systems that integrate with Kubernetes and other container technologies. I've got passable frontend experience with Vue and React, but I'd much rather be knee-deep in an API. I consider my top three things to be:

- Go
- Kubernetes
- SRE/DevOps
  - Observability
  - GCP
  - Reliability & Incident Management

In terms of softer skills, I've really come to enjoy mentoring more junior engineers. When it comes to building products, I'm a huge fan of the Lean Startup's scientific approach to building incremental MVPs closely with customers to ensure that the product meets a real need.

## 💰 Want to hire me?

I'm not actively looking for new opportunities. That being said, I'm open to conversations if you:

- Are part of the company that's hiring (no recruitment agencies please!)
- Can provide details of the compensation package upfront
- Won't make me complete "competitive coding challenges" a la HackerRank
- Support remote work
- Are not in the business of manufacturing weapons, shilling crypto or lending money predatorily (etc.)
- Value employees who take a high level of ownership and trust them to make decisions
- Most importantly, do something exciting that makes the world better!

If that sounds like you, I'd welcome an email to hiring@noahstride.co.uk
