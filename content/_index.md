Hey! I'm Noah, a software engineer based on the South Coast of the United Kingdom. Outside of work, you can find me playing bass, running or playing video games.

I love working with Go & infrastructure (especially GCP):

- Go
- Kubernetes
- SRE/DevOps (Observability)

Or ping me an email: hi@noahstride.co.uk

I'm not actively looking for new opportunities, but if you've got something super exciting with worthy compensation
package, please feel free to get in touch (unless you are in the predatory payday lending industry or an arms dealer).

**So long, and thanks for all the fish**
