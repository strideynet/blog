Hey! I'm Noah, a software engineer based in London. I'm a huge music fiend and can almost always be found listening to something! In the summer, I run and climb. In the winter, I ski. I'm also an [amateur radio enthusiast](./wiki/amateur-radio)!

## 👨‍💻 Work

I'm a product-focussed engineer on a mission to meet users' needs - whether they be an internal team or a customer. You'll find me happiest in a role which lets me engage with users and participate actively in the product process, and solve plenty of challenging technical problems! 

I currently lead a team that builds products in the workload identity space (an emerging field that's captured my heart), but over the past few years I've worked as a backend engineer and SRE at a variety of startups.

For all the details, check out [my CV](/cv).

## 💰 Want to hire me?

I'm not actively looking for new opportunities. That being said, I'm open to conversations if you:

- Are part of the company that's hiring (no recruitment agencies please!)
- Can provide details of the compensation package upfront
- Won't make me complete "competitive coding challenges" a la HackerRank
- Support remote work
- Are not in the business of manufacturing weapons, shilling crypto or lending money predatorily (etc.)
- Value employees who take a high level of ownership and trust them to make decisions
- Most importantly, do something exciting that makes the world better!

If that sounds like you, I'd welcome an email to hiring@noahstride.co.uk
