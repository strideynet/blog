Hey! I'm Noah, a software engineer based on the South Coast of the United Kingdom. Outside of work, you can find me playing bass, running or playing video games.

I prefer working with backend/infrastructure, but can also build passable front-ends when needed. I could bore you with a long list, but I won't, so here's my top three things:

- Golang
- Kubernetes
- Typescript/Javascript NodeJS

Find me online:

- [Github](https://github.com/strideynet)
- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/strideynet)
- [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nstride/)

Or ping me an email: hi@noahstride.co.uk

I'm not actively looking for new opportunities, but if you've got something super exciting with worthy compensation
package, please feel free to get in touch (unless you are in the predatory payday lending industry or an arms dealer).

**So long, and thanks for all the fish**
