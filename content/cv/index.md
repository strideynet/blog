### Cudo Ventures | Software Engineer | August 2018 - May 2020

I joined Cudo Ventures as a fullstack engineer straight out of college, working on the NodeJS API, Electron App and Vue
web app, but as the team grew my role to focus solely on backend development and infrastructure, eventually providing
support and mentoring as Cudo used Golang in production for the first time.

At Cudo, I held multiple responsibilites from managing the Kubernetes clusters, infrastructure tools (e.g Prometheus/Grafana)
and deployment mechanisms, as well as working directly with customers where they had more unusual deployments of our
product into datacenter environments. As one of the engineers with a more indepth understanding of Linux, networking and
datacenter environments, I was able to provide insight and knowledge to other members of the team.

Some of the techs I worked with at Cudo:

- Frontend: Vue, Vuex, React, Redux, Electron
- Backend: Javascript (Loopback), Typescript, Golang
- Ops: GCP, Kubernetes, Ansible (Kubespray)

### Freelancing & Consulting | November 2016 - Ongoing

Since late 2016 I've completed freelance projects for a variety of clients with a focus on quality delivery of a solution
that meets the client's needs. Projects are generally fullstack web applications, but I have also provided consulting to
other developers on scaling their projects and deploying them onto cloud platforms.
