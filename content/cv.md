## Experience

### Krystal | Senior Engineer | April 2021 - Present

More info coming soon :)

### Cudo Ventures | Senior Engineer | December 2020 - April 2021

I returned to Cudo to take a lead on SRE and Operations matters. I have continued to push for the uptake of Go and
microservices at Cudo, using my experience from WalkUp.

Using the following techs:

- Kubernetes on GCP
- Prometheus, Grafana and Chronosphere
- Pulumi & Helm
- Go, Node (Typescript and Javascript)
- MySQL

### WalkUp | Senior Backend Engineer | June 2020 - December 2020

When I started at WalkUp I was the engineer responsible for scaling the backend from handling 40,000 guests per week to
in excess of 800,000 per week in just three months. This involved scoping out reliability and scaling issues within
a pre-existing codebase and rectifying them, whilst maintaining a balance with the development of new features to
improve the service. As the company grew, I took on the mentorship of a junior backend engineer.

Event-driven microservices architecture with a focus on reliability & scaleability, using techs such as:

- Golang
- GCP
- Kubernetes, Helm, Prometheus and Grafana
- RabbitMQ
- Redis
- Firestore

### Cudo Ventures | Software Engineer | August 2018 - June 2020

I joined Cudo Ventures as a fullstack engineer straight out of college, working on the NodeJS API, Electron App and Vue
web app, but as the team grew my role to focus solely on backend development and infrastructure, eventually providing
support and mentoring as Cudo used Golang in production for the first time.

At Cudo, I held multiple responsibilites from managing the Kubernetes clusters, infrastructure tools (e.g Prometheus/Grafana)
and deployment mechanisms, as well as working directly with customers where they had more unusual deployments of our
product into datacenter environments. As one of the engineers with a more indepth understanding of Linux, networking and
datacenter environments, I was able to provide insight and knowledge to other members of the team.

Some of the techs I worked with at Cudo:

- Frontend: Vue, Vuex, React, Redux, Electron
- Backend: Javascript (Loopback), Typescript, Golang
- Ops: GCP, Kubernetes, Ansible (Kubespray)

### Freelancing & Consulting | November 2016 - Ongoing

Since late 2016 I've completed freelance projects for a variety of clients with a focus on quality delivery of a solution
that meets the client's needs. Projects are generally fullstack web applications, but I have also provided consulting to
other developers on scaling their projects and deploying them onto cloud platforms.
