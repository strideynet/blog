At the start of May, I embarked on a new adventure: joining Teleport as a Software Engineer. It was a bittersweet moment, because I'd really enjoyed my work at Krystal and was worried that the culture of Teleport might not match that of Krystal, but I decided to take the jump because Teleport was a product that had me really excited. I'd trialled it a few years ago, and I really felt that Teleport would offer me the chance to get knuckles deep on a project that integrates tightly with Linux.

## My fears

I had a couple fears:

- I wouldn't be good enough
- The company, and codebase, is much larger than anything I'm used to. Would I cope?
- Fully remote, and far apart from my colleagues.

## My fears: allayed

- Really enjoying the challenge of the codebase, and identifying ways in which we can improve.
