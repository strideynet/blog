I've been doing a lot of thinking recently, and realised that I ought to formalise some of this thinking somewhere I can come back and look at it at a later date. I think I'll probably try and write here a little more, because I could do with trying to think more about how I style myself in writing, and perhaps some of the things I've been thinking might be useful to some folks out there on the internet.

I can certainly blame this sudden urge to write more on having recently re-read Robert Pirsig's *Zen and the Art of Motorycycle Maintenance*. Pirsig's tale of a motorcycle journey across America intertwined with philosophical chatauquas is engaging, and challenging, and forces you explore concepts that may not have occured to you before. It's a book I've read a good three to four times now, and I imagine I'll come back to it again in a year or two as my view on the world changes. Anyone with a brief interest in philosophy should certainly give it a go.
