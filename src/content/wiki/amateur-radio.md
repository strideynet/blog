Hey, I'm Noah - on the air, you'll know me as G5OTT. I obtained my foundation license in 2023, my intermediate in 2025 and my full in 2026.

My QTH is London which limits my opportunities to operate. As such, I'll usually be found operating portable. Where I 
can, I try to activate POTA parks! I'm fond of FT8 and SSB across 40, 30 and 20m bands.

Please submit QSOs via Logbook of the World. I occasionally sync my QSOs to QRZ and eQSL, however, this occurs on a much
less regular basis.

I operate using:

- Icom IC705 or IC7300
  - SOTABeam Bandhopper III
  - Alpha Antenna AL705 Magloop
  - DXCommander Venture
- Anytone AT-D878UVII
- LiteVNA

Other interests:

- LoRA
- Packet Radio
- Linux

Callsign history:

## Contests

I've entered contests with differing "levels of effort". I've scored the "effort" we've put into contests on a scale
from 1-5. 5 would indicate building out a contest-specific station and assembling a team, and 1 would indicate a very
casual dip into a contest.
